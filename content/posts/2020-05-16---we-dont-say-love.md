Below is a piece in iambic pentameter I was working on a couple of months ago:


**We Don't Say Love**  

In Chinese, we don’t say love.  
Instead my mother asks, “<ruby>
你 <rp>(</rp><rt>nǐ</rt><rp>)</rp>
吃 <rp>(</rp><rt>chī</rt><rp>)</rp>
了 <rp>(</rp><rt>le</rt><rp>)</rp>
吗 <rp>(</rp><rt>ma</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>”			                    (“have you eaten”)  
Repeatedly as if I never ate  
When I was far from home. She says it like  
I'd only miss the warmth of homemade soups  
And not the warmth of sitting next to her  
On weekend evenings as we watched TV.  
In Mandarin, we don’t admit our love.  
Instead my mother brought a plate of fruit  
Up to my room in silence while I slept  
Before departing home for work each day.  
We don’t say love. Instead we might say “<ruby>
疼 <rp>(</rp><rt>téng</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>”																		(“to hurt/to love fondly”)  
As if to note that love inherently  
Implies self-sacrifice. We might say this,  
But never love. For love is too simple  
A word. Just two small letters in a row;  
A single syllable that manifests  
With barely any effort from within.  
And love is way too large a word to be  
Encompassed utterly in a small one.  
So, in my family, we don’t say love.  
Instead, as I depart my room each day  
I call my mom to ask, “你吃了吗?"  


Thanks for tuning in to my first blog post! I originally wrote this poem for a class that I was taking this past semester as a way to develop my poetry-writing and learn to play around with meter. A bit about this poem: it’s written in iambic pentameter blank verse, which means that end rhymes are purposely excluded. I wanted to post this here since I feel like a lot of people I grew up with can relate to the message it conveys in context of their families.

Growing up, I struggled to reconcile the often-opposing sides of my identity. As a Chinese-American, I’ve found it hard to know how to balance the two cultures and up to a certain point, I consistently chose American ideals over those of Chinese heritage. I just perceived the family-first, honor-chasing, suffer and sacrifice in silence mentality an extremely backward way of viewing the world. I’ve since learned to better appreciate this aspect of Chinese culture—as misdirected our actions may be, they are done in good faith and echo the depth of our love for one another.

I’ve always wondered why there isn’t much outwardly expression of love in Chinese society; it’s almost as if our overwhelming and sometimes toxic idolization of honor and face forbids us from showing the vulnerability and tenderness of love. Having to read in between the lines whenever someone says or does something has affected the way that I see others, often leading me to jump to conclusions about peoples’ intentions and motives for everything they do. I’m still trying to internalize that sometimes this is just the way things are—we learn to value people in different ways and how we choose to express that is just a result of our cultural upbringing and personal experiences through life. Chinese people don’t express love outwardly since love as a concept is more closely associated with duty and responsibility rather than outward affection in Chinese culture. Instead of saying words that are temporary and easy to fake, we express love through actions that convey this underlying sense of duty, which is why Asian parents seem a bit crazy at times. On a side note, I recently read a pretty interesting post about the 5 love languages, but in the context of Asian parenting. You can find the post here.

A reason that I wanted to include Chinese phrases and words in this poem is largely because of some of my recent discoveries about language as a construct. Since we communicate with one another on a daily basis, it’s easy to overlook any specific language simply as a form of communication that can be interchanged as long as both communicating parties had mastery of a different language. I think it’s a little deeper than this though—language is not only a form of communication but also an indicator of one’s culture and identity.

An example of this is the existence of words or phrases that can’t be translated into a different language. Words like 吃苦 or 幸福 can’t be translated into English since they describe the collective experience of Chinese society throughout time and neither direct translations or counterparts in another language and touch the nuance and connotation of these words. Of course, Obviously Mandarin is not the only language that has words like these—all languages and dialects of languages have these words that serve as unique identifiers of a region's social and cultural values.

Hi there! My name is Jerry Qin and I'm currently a 3rd-year at Vanderbilt University studying math and computer science. I'm specifically interested in data analysis and visualization, quantitative finance, and applications of probability and number theory. At Vanderbilt, I am a TA for Math 1100 (Survey of Calculus) and research probability distributions of partition functions. In addition I'm a member of [Alpha Kappa Psi](http://vuakpsi.org/) and help run [VandyHack's](https://vandyhacks.org/) sponsorship committee.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I play tennis and write poetry. I'm also extremely interested in comedy, specifically political satire and impressions, and have recently begun exploring stand-up at open mics (although this has been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic). If any of these interest you, please <a href="mailto: jerry.qin@vanderbilt.edu">reach out</a> and we can chat!

Hi there! My name is Jerry Qin and I'm currently a 3rd-year at Vanderbilt University studying math and computer science. My interests include data analysis and visualization, quantitative finance, and applications of probability and number theory. At Vanderbilt, I TA for Math 1100 (Survey of Calculus) and research probability distributions of partition functions. In addition I'm a member of [Alpha Kappa Psi](http://vuakpsi.org/) and help run [VandyHack's](https://vandyhacks.org/) sponsorship committee.

Aside from my academic involvements, I enjoy playing tennis and writing poetry. I'm also extremely interested in comedy, specifically political satire and impressions (I'm a huge Trevor Noah fan), and have recently begun exploring stand-up at open mics in Nashville. If any of these interest you, please <a href="mailto: jerry.qin@vanderbilt.edu">reach out</a> and we can chat!

###Directed Reading

I'm currently working on a list of topics in mathematics that are pertinent to my research and some of my general interests. I've posted some of my notes and other resources below for reference.

- [Partition Cranks and Ramanujan Congruences](Resources/Partition_Cranks_and_Ramanujan_Congruences.pdf): Some general background on partitions and the motivation behind rank and crank functions in number theory
- [Generating Functions and the Fibonacci Numbers](Resources/Fibonacci_Generating_Functions.pdf): A quick introduction to generating functions and their application to finding recurrence relations
- [Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem & Applications](Resources/Brouwers_Theorem.pdf): A discussion of Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem and its game theory applications (work in progress)

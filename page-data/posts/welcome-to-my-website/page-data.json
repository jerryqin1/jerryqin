This is the first of hopefully many posts that I’ll be uploading onto this platform. This website has been a goal of mine for a while now and the quarantine has given me an opportunity (in my boredom) to finally get on top of it. I’ve been challenging myself recently to write more in an attempt to document my thoughts and become a more mindful person in the process. </p>\n<p>I hope to be posting every couple of weeks or so on a variety of topics but primarily on mathematics, poetry, and stand-up, along with general ideas and discussions I find interesting. This will include updates on my research, drafts of poems I’ve been working on, and commentary on current events and pop culture. Hopefully this blog will become a collection of such content that can provide some insight on some of these topics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"moving-forward\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#moving-forward\" aria-label=\"moving forward permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Moving Forward</h3>\n<p>I’ll be posting semi-regularly and adding functionality to this website as I become more comfortable with web development. I’m currently working on setting up a subscription for people who are interested in keeping up with this blog and other details as I decide on where I want to to take this (If you’re interested in subscribing, head over to this <a href=\"https://forms.gle/xvFZcg22b1UGURso9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">form</a> and I will add you to the mailing list after I have it set up). If you’re interested in learning more about me, please feel free to navigate around this site or email me at <a href=\"mailto: jerry.qin@vanderbilt.edu\">jerry.qin@vanderbilt.edu</a>. In the meantime, thanks for tuning in and I hope you’ll find some of the content illuminating and thought-provoking.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/welcome-to-my-website","tagSlugs":["/tag/miscellaneous/","/tag/updates/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-05-12T22:40:32.169Z","description":"A quick introduction to my blog!","tags":["Miscellaneous","Updates"],"title":"Welcome to My Website!","socialImage":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/welcome-to-my-website"}}}

My name is Jerry Qin and I’m currently a 3rd-year at Vanderbilt University studying math and computer science. My interests include data analysis and visualization, quantitative finance, and applications of probability and number theory. At Vanderbilt, I TA for Math 1100 (Survey of Calculus) and research probability distributions of partition functions. In addition I’m a member of <a href=\"http://vuakpsi.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Alpha Kappa Psi</a> and help run <a href=\"https://vandyhacks.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">VandyHack’s</a> sponsorship committee.</p>\n<p>Aside from my academic involvements, I enjoy playing tennis and writing poetry. I’m also extremely interested in comedy, specifically political satire and impressions (I’m a huge Trevor Noah fan), and have recently begun exploring stand-up at open mics in Nashville. If any of these interest you, please <a href=\"mailto: jerry.qin@vanderbilt.edu\">reach out</a> and we can chat!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About Me","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":"/media/image-2.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}}}

My name is Jerry Qin and I’m currently a 3rd-year at Vanderbilt University studying math and computer science. I’m specifically interested in data analysis and visualization, quantitative finance, and applications of probability and number theory. At Vanderbilt, I am a TA for Math 1100 (Survey of Calculus) and research probability distributions of partition functions. In addition I’m a member of <a href=\"http://vuakpsi.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Alpha Kappa Psi</a> and help run <a href=\"https://vandyhacks.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">VandyHack’s</a> sponsorship committee.</p>\n<p>Apart from my academic pursuits, I play tennis and write poetry. I’m also extremely interested in comedy, specifically political satire and impressions, and have recently begun exploring stand-up at open mics (although this has been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic). If any of these interest you, please <a href=\"mailto: jerry.qin@vanderbilt.edu\">reach out</a> and we can chat!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About Me","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":"/media/image-2.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}}}
